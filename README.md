## About 
This project is a simple application designed to learn about the usage of fragments and gridview in Android app development. The app consists of three different fragments: the home page, profile, and settings. When on the home page, users can view a grid-list of items, such as anime characters with associated names. Users can also switch between fragments using bottom navigation, allowing them to navigate through different sections of the app easily.
